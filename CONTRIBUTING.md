# How can I get involved?


|Activity|Description|
|-|-|
|Report a bug|We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) to keep track of known bugs. We keep a close eye on them and update them when we have an internal fix in progress. Before you report a new issue, do your best to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported. If it has, just leave a comment on the existing issue, rather than create a new one. <br /> If you have already checked the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) and are still convinced that you have found odd or erroneous behaviour then please file a new one.|
|Propose a new feature|If you have new ideas for Kedro functionality then please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) and describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.|
|Review pull requests|Check the [Kedro repo to find open pull requests](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/pulls) and contribute a review!|
|Contribute a fix or feature|If you're interested in contributing fixes to code or documentation, first read our [guidelines for contributing developers](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/14_contribution/02_developer_contributor_guidelines.html) for an explanation of how to get set up and the process you'll follow.  Once you are ready to contribute, a good place to start is to take a look at the `good first issues` and `help wanted issues` on [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues).|
|Contribute to the documentation|You can help us improve the [Kedro documentation online](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Send us feedback as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) or start a documentation discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/discussions).You are also welcome to make a raise a PR with a bug fix or addition to the documentation. First read the guide [Contribute to the Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/14_contribution/04_documentation_contributor_guidelines.html).


# Joining our Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
<img src="static/img/lfaidata-project-badge-incubation-color.png" width="200">

As part of the [Linux Foundation for AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) the project is governed by our TSC, you can read about this in detail in our [Technical Charter](todo).

## Becoming a maintainer

As a Linux Foundation project we inivite members of the community to join us in maintaining and defining the future of Kedro. This status also entitles you to voting rights.


### Responsibilities

- Be available for 1+ full day per week (summarized) on product development
- Attendance at community meetings to discuss the project plans, roadmap and commitments
- Screen [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) issues and perform pull request (PR) reviews
  - The screening process includes applying suitable [labels](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/labels) to each new issue. Labels are handy for future issue follow-up. A few of the most important labels that are:
    - `good first issue` - Mark any issue that can reasonably be accomplished by a new contributor with this label
    - `help wanted` - Unless it is immediately obvious that someone will work on a specific issue (and if so assign
     it), mark it help wanted
    - `status: to be verified` - If the reported bug needs to be reproduced before working on a fix
    - `status: needs more info` - If the issue needs more information from the person who reported it
  - See all the [labels](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/labels). Try to maintain 3-5 labels per issue
- Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
- Guide the community to use the right channel: [Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/) for Issues and Bug-reports; and forums and Discord for questions and discussions
- Project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds, infrastructure
- Prioritize the work following [Kedro Roadmap](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/projects/1) to move the
 project forward
- Follow-up by filing undocumented issues found in community channels


### Application requirements

- Spend at least one full day per week on Kedro for the foreseeable future
- Write solid code and collaborate with the team and community
- Understand the project's code base and internals
- Learn how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
- Have already started PRs and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; ask for help where needed

Besides activities listed above section, you need to demonstrate a strong commitment to Kedro's long-term success.
Just contributing does not make you a maintainer. It is about building trust with the current maintainers of the project and being a person they can depend on and trust to make decisions in the best interest of Kedro.

Quarterly, existing maintainers will curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed.

#### How we integrate you into the team?
- We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
- We will require a period of working with existing maintainers
- After a vote, maintainers will be added to the Kedro GitHub organization and [OWNERS.md](todo)


## Removing a Maintainer
The TSC will also have a mechanism for removing a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above. In that case, they should volunteer for non-voting Contributor or Friends status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote by the active TSC.
