# Join the Technical Steering Committee

## Responsibilities

* Product development:
  * Be available for at least one full day per week to help with product development
  * Attend community meetings to discuss the project plans and roadmap
  * Project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds and infrastructure
  * Prioritize the work following the product roadmap to move the project forward
* Community management:
  * Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
  * Guide the community to use the right channel:
    * [Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/) for feature requests and bug reports
    * [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/akJDeVaxnB), but the former is often preferable since it will be picked up by search engines


## Application requirements

- Spend at least one full day per week on Kedro for the foreseeable future
- Write solid code and collaborate with the team and community
- Understand the project's code base and internals
- Learn how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
- Have already started PRs and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; ask for help where needed

Besides activities listed above section, you need to demonstrate a strong commitment to Kedro's long-term success.
Just contributing does not make you a maintainer. It is about building trust with the current maintainers of the project and being a person they can depend on and trust to make decisions in the best interest of Kedro.

Quarterly, existing maintainers will curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed.

### How we integrate you into the team?
- We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
- We will require a period of working with existing maintainers
- After a vote, maintainers will be added to the Kedro GitHub organization


# Removing a Maintainer
The TSC will also have a mechanism for removing a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above. In that case, they should volunteer for non-voting Contributor or Friends status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote by the active TSC.
