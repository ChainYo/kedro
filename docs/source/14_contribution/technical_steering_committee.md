# Join the Technical Steering Committee

## Responsibilities

- Be available for 1+ full day per week (summarized) on product development
- Attendance at community meetings to discuss the project plans, roadmap and commitments
- Screen [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) issues and perform pull request (PR) reviews
  - The screening process includes applying suitable [labels](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/labels) to each new issue. Labels are handy for future issue follow-up. A few of the most important labels that are:
    - `good first issue` - Mark any issue that can reasonably be accomplished by a new contributor with this label
    - `help wanted` - Unless it is immediately obvious that someone will work on a specific issue (and if so assign
     it), mark it help wanted
    - `status: to be verified` - If the reported bug needs to be reproduced before working on a fix
    - `status: needs more info` - If the issue needs more information from the person who reported it
  - See all the [labels](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/labels). Try to maintain 3-5 labels per issue
- Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
- Guide the community to use the right channel: [Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/) for Issues and Bug-reports; and forums and Discord for questions and discussions
- Project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds, infrastructure
- Prioritize the work following [Kedro Roadmap](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/projects/1) to move the
 project forward
- Follow-up by filing undocumented issues found in community channels


## Application requirements

- Spend at least one full day per week on Kedro for the foreseeable future
- Write solid code and collaborate with the team and community
- Understand the project's code base and internals
- Learn how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
- Have already started PRs and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; ask for help where needed

Besides activities listed above section, you need to demonstrate a strong commitment to Kedro's long-term success.
Just contributing does not make you a maintainer. It is about building trust with the current maintainers of the project and being a person they can depend on and trust to make decisions in the best interest of Kedro.

Quarterly, existing maintainers will curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed.

### How we integrate you into the team?
- We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
- We will require a period of working with existing maintainers
- After a vote, maintainers will be added to the Kedro GitHub organization and [OWNERS.md](todo)


# Removing a Maintainer
The TSC will also have a mechanism for removing a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above. In that case, they should volunteer for non-voting Contributor or Friends status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote by the active TSC.
